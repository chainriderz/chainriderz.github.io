                    frequent exams are encouraged.<br>
                    A routine examination provides you and your doctor with the
                    opportunity to develop a comprehensive picture of your pet&#39;s
                    overall health as well as to spot potential medical issues before
                    they become serious health concerns. It&#39;s also an opportunity
                    for you to ask your veterinarian important questions about
                    your pet&#39;s health, habits and daily care. We also use this time to
                    inform you about home healthcare for your pet and offer

                    Beyond spay and neuter surgeries, <b>Prolife Speciality Vet Clinic
                    performs an array of orthopedic and soft tissue surgeries.
                    Soft tissue surgeries include, but are not limited to gastric
                    dilatation-volvulus (stomach bloat), C-section, Splenectomy,
                    Declaw, Cherry Eye Repair, Anal Sac Removal, Cystotomy,

                    Orthopedic surgeries include fracture repair with bone plates,
                    screws and pins, as well as tightrope and extracapsular stabilization
                    for ruptured cruciates, and more.

                    Prolife speciality vet clinic has newly introduced the technique
                    called <kbd>Laparoscopy</kbd> for the exploratory abdominal surgery</b>
                    Laparoscopic surgery is often performed for very specific reasons.
                    This type of surgical procedure is highly efficient for its intended
                    purposes. Exploratory laparoscopy allows your veterinarian to
                    explore your dog’s abdomen with minimal pain. Laparoscopic surgery
                    is minimally invasive and allows your dog an easier and faster
                    recovery with less pain than the traditional surgical methods for the
                    same outcome.
                    There are alternative methods to laparoscopic surgeries. However,
                    they usually involve large incisions and longer recoveries. Even a spay
                    surgery for female dogs is a much different surgery when it is done
                    laparoscopically. In the traditional spay surgery, the entire

                    reproductive system is removed from the dog from one or two large
                    incisions. With a laparoscopic spay surgery, only the ovaries are
                    removed from two small incisions. This is an effective surgery with
                    the same result and easier recovery for your dog.
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="heading">Reducing Safety Risks and Discomfort</h4>
                    It’s natural to be concerned for your pet’s safety before they go into surgery,
                    but we can help put you at ease. Here are some of the things we do to give
                    your pet the best experience:<br>
                    &#9642; We examine and screen every pet before their surgery to check for signs of
                    poor health. Anaesthesia and other factors can increase safety risks if your pet
                    has an underlying health problem.<br>
                    &#9642; All materials and equipment in the surgical suite are thoroughly sterilized and
                    maintained at all times.<br>
                    &#9642; We measure anaesthesia, antibiotics, pain relief, and other medications
                    according to your pet’s size, age, and overall condition.<br>
                    &#9642; Our veterinarians and technicians are thoroughly trained in handling your pet
                    with care, keeping them calm, and reading their vital signs accurately during
                    their procedure. The monitoring equipment we use allows us to notice changes
                    in your pet’s vitals immediately, including ECG and oxygen saturation.<br>
                    &#9642; After surgery, your pet receives intensive care to make sure they’re
                    comfortable and waking up safely.<br></p>

                    <p>It’s impossible to say how many animal lives have been saved
                    or improved thanks to spaying and neutering, but we know the
                    number is high! That’s why we recommend spay and neuter

                    other dogs and cats
                    <h4 class="heading">How Spaying and Neutering Helps Pets</h4>

                    Your pet’s spay or neuter surgery has a greater effect than you might realize.
                    1. The more pets that are spayed and neutered, the fewer unwanted pregnancies
                    there will be. Many shelters and rescues are overcrowded due to so many
                    litters being born.
                    2. It benefits your pet directly by reducing their chances of developing cancer
                    later in life. Females may otherwise be prone to breast cancer and ovarian
                    cancer. Likewise, males that are not neutered have a higher risk for testicular
                    cancer.
                    3. Pyometra is a serious condition that can affect non-spayed female dogs and
                    cats. It is a bacterial infection caused by a hormonal imbalance that can be
                    deadly if it isn’t treated quickly.
                    4. Male and female pets can also show improved behavior after their surgery.
                    Male dogs are less prone to aggression and urine spraying/marking. Both
                    males and females are also less likely to go roaming around outside to find a
                    mating partner, which can put their safety at risk.</p>

                    Most pet allergies are caused by external parasites, food allergens, or
                    environmental allergens. We will thoroughly examine your pet and perform
                    the necessary tests to help us identify the underlying cause of the allergy.
                    <h4 class="heading">Indications of pet allergies include:</h4>
                    &#9642; Itchy skin<br>

                    Our veterinarians are dedicated to helping clients figure out their pet’s
                    problems and achieving the best possible outcome after treatment. We use
                    the latest testing methods and medications to help us identify the allergens
                    that are bothering your pet, and manage the allergy itself.
                    Allergies do not occur without reason. In addition to treating your pet, our goal
                    is to educate you about why allergies occur in pets in the first place, what
                    secondary changes result from the allergies, and how we can support you and
                    your pet through the treatment process.</p>

                    <p><h4 class="heading">Computerized Radiography</h4>
                    Radiographs (X-rays) are extremely helpful for diagnosing and
                    monitoring many medical and surgical conditions. X-rays are useful in
                    examining your pet&#39;s bones, lungs, heart, abdomen, oral cavity and other
                    areas of the body. When used in conjunction with other diagnostic
                    procedures like ultrasound, X-rays can accurately diagnose problems,
                    making treatment faster and easier for your pet and your veterinarian.
                    To provide your pet with the clear and significant medical diagnosis,
                    Prolife Specialty Vet Clinc uses the latest in computerized radiology
                    equipment as a part of your pet&#39;s medical care. Digital radiographic
                    images are far more detailed and offer a range of features that enhance
                    your veterinarian&#39;s ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Because our
                    radiographs are digital, we are also able to save them in the patient
                    history for further reference.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4 class="heading">Ultrasound</h4>
                    Ultrasound is a pain-free, totally non-invasive technique that uses high-
                    frequency sound waves to produce a real-time image of your pet&#39;s
                    internal organs. For many applications, ultrasound can be more useful
                    than radiographs by providing a movie of what is happening inside your
                    pet&#39;s body. Ultrasound also works well in conjunction with other
                    diagnostic tools and a wide range of diagnostic procedures. Using the
                    ultrasound image as a guide, surgical biopsies can be obtained without
                    major surgery and your pet can often go home the same day.
                    Ultrasounds are typically not stressful for your pet and take anywhere
                    from 30 to 60 minutes to perform. Prolife Specialty Vet Clinic uses a
                    newly-upgraded ultrasound technology. We carry out up-to-date
                    ultrasound-assisted procedures, which include abdominal studies,
                    ultrasound-guided aspirates, ultrasound-guided cystocentesis, and
                    emergency ultrasounds. Our veterinarians give a detailed explanation
                    about the Ultrasound report that is generated post scan where you can
                    learn about the diagnosis that is made and the further measures that are
                    to be taken by the veterinarian.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4 class="heading">Endoscopy</h4>
                    To gain a view into the body veterinarians often employ the use of
                    endoscopes. These are small cameras designed to be inserted into the
                    body and then project a motion picture onto a computer screen for your
                    doctor to view the insides of your pet’s anatomy and make an
                    evaluation. This type of veterinary scope also includes tools to allow the
                    veterinarian to take tissue samples and perform a range of procedures.
                    Veterinary endoscopy allows a more complete examination of the
                    esophagus, stomach, and some areas of the intestines in order to
                    diagnose gastrointestinal disorders, cancerous growths, polyps, and
                    other problems.<br>
                    The endoscope is also useful in obtaining samples of potentially infected
                    or cancerous material and serves as the visual aid during a biopsy,
                    allowing our veterinarians to obtain the best sample for evaluation. This
                    helps diagnose malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract as well as
                    gastrointestinal disorders.
                    The endoscope also aids in the removal of foreign bodies. Animals often
                    swallow objects that cannot be digested or passed through the digestive
                    tract. The endoscope allows better vision of the digestive tract so these
                    objects may be removed without major surgery.
                    We are equipped with sophisticated medical technologies like an
                    endoscope and a team of skilled veterinarians to provide an easy and
                    painless view, diagnose and often treat a range of problems without
                    performing invasive surgery.

                    <h4 class="heading">Our Lab</h4>
                    Performing preventive medicine as well as diagnosing emergent internal
                    health issues requires the ability to perform a wide range of laboratory
                    tests on blood, urine, feces, and biopsied tissue. Without timely access
                    to precise laboratory test results it is difficult to make an accurate
                    diagnosis or assessment of your pet&#39;s health.
                    Prolife Speciality Vet Clinic has a complete in-house laboratory that
                    allows us to perform Urinalysis, Parasite Identification, Complete
                    Chemistry Profiles, Clotting Profiles, and many such laboratory
                    procedures that provide adequate information about your patient that is
                    further assisted by the examination of the doctor. In some cases, we can
                    also give the results of few of the laboratory examination in minutes!</p>
